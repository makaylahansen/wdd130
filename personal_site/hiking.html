            <p>Here at Willard, there is a wide variety of fun nearby hikes. The Willard Waterfall hike is a great medium difficult to hard hike. On the hike, there is a small waterfall that can be seen at the completion of the trail. However, the closer you get to the waterfall, the harder the hike gets. If you want a more medium trail, you can follow that path all the way to a small bridge. There you will see a small waterfall and stream. Be warned, the main waterfall can only be seen during its prime time. The best time to experience the full beauty if the hike is in the late Spring, right when the snow runoff starts to come. This hike tends to be best suited for teenagers and adults. The trail is steep and sheer in some places. This makes it harder for young kids who are less experienced.</p>

            <p>Bryce Canyon also has a wide variety of hikes ranging from all levels. For those with younger kids who struggle to hike, you can stay on the man board walk that is at the top of the canyon. For those who have more experience, there are many hikes that lead down to the bottom of the canyon. From there, you can choose from the many options. Be warned! What comes down must go up! Make sure to also check on any updates on flash floods, otherwise your trip will be done in, well, a flash!</p>
